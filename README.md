# JDKKiller
JDKKiller is a piece of software that runs in the background and force kills the JDK process whenever Clickteam is closed. This is done to prevent Steam from thinking that Clickteam is still running

It's recommended that you use Android Studio's JBR for exporting your Clickteam games, because using a separate JDK install can cause issues (e.g. kill your Minecraft process).
JBR can be found in Android Studio\jbr
