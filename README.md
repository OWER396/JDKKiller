# JDKKiller
JDKKiller is a piece of software that runs in the background and force kills the JDK process whenever Clickteam is closed. This is done to prevent Steam from thinking that Clickteam is still running

I recommend adding it to your shell:startup so you don't have to manually start it each time

# Requirements
- .NET 6.0
